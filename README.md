 Hotel Booking Website(Tree With Shelter)
 
This is a hotel booking website built using Node.js and Express.js with MongoDB as the database. The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and incorporates user authentication, authorization, and error handling for a smooth and secure user experience.

Features:
1. User Authentication
Login and Signup functionality for user registration and access.
Passport is used for managing user authentication, ensuring secure login with session-based management.

2. User Authorization
Users are allowed to delete their own reviews only, ensuring they can only modify content theyâ€™ve submitted.
This is handled through user-specific authorization using Passport.

3. Database Management
MongoDB is used for storing user data, bookings, and reviews in a NoSQL format, making it scalable and efficient for large datasets.

4. Session Management
Express-session middleware is used to manage user sessions, ensuring that users remain logged in across multiple pages during their visit.
